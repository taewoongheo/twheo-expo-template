# twheo-expo-template

This template is designed for solo developers and small projects that require maximum speed and minimum boilerplate.

It is based on the proven architecture of [obytes](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes), but stripped down to its essentials. The goal is to provide a clean and simple foundation without unnecessary features, allowing you to focus solely on building your core product.
